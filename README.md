📊 Project Report: New Zealand Crime Data Analysis

Project Title: New Zealand Crime Report Analysis
Intern/Analyst: [Your Name]
Duration: June 2025 – August 2025
Tools Used: Python (Pandas), Microsoft Excel, Power BI
Objective:
To analyze crime, population, and vehicle data across New Zealand regions to uncover meaningful insights for public safety awareness and decision-making.

🔧 1. Data Collection & Preparation

Data Sources: Provided datasets on population, crime reports, and vehicle classifications.

Cleaning Process (Python – Pandas):

Handled missing values using imputation or removal.

Standardized data types (e.g., integers for population, datetime for crime dates).

Removed duplicates and ensured consistency in categorical values.

Validation: Cleaned datasets were exported to CSV format and validated manually in Excel before visualization.

📈 2. Key Insights from Analysis
📍 Top 5 Regions by Population:
Rank	Region	Population
1	Auckland	1,695,200
2	Canterbury	655,000
3	Wellington	543,500
4	Waikato	513,800
5	Bay of Plenty	347,700
🌆 Top 5 Regions by Population Density:
Rank	Region	Density (People/km²)
1	Auckland	343
2	Nelson	129
3	Wellington	68
4	Bay of Plenty	29
5	Waikato	22
🚘 Vehicle Make Type Insights:

Standard make type had the most make names (123).

Luxury make type had the least make names (15).

📅 Crime Trend Analysis:

Month with highest crime rate: April 2022

Quarter with highest crime rate: Quarter 1 (January – March)

📍 Region with Most Reported Crimes:

Auckland had the highest number of crime incidents overall.

📊 3. Dashboard Development in Power BI

Imported cleaned datasets into Power BI.

Created an interactive dashboard showing:

Crime trends over time (monthly, quarterly).

Crime rates by region and location.

Make types and vehicle distribution.

Population vs. crime correlation.

Used DAX for calculated columns and custom KPIs.

Enabled filter-based exploration by region, category, and time.

📌 4. Outcome & Recommendations

Auckland is a key focus area for both population growth and crime prevention.

Quarter 1 consistently shows elevated crime activity – requires resource allocation planning.

Policymakers should target Standard vehicle types for tracking due to higher variety.

Visual insights can support law enforcement, city planning, and community outreach.

🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated

Python (Pandas): Data cleaning, wrangling, and export

Excel: Validation and data review

Power BI: Data modeling, dashboard creation, KPI analysis

EDA Techniques: Region-wise segmentation, time series analysis, categorical comparison

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis pipeline, from raw data cleaning in Python to executive-level dashboarding in Power BI. It provides actionable insights into crime distribution across New Zealand and can assist local authorities and planners in addressing public safety challenges.
